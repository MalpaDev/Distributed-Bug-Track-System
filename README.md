# Distributed-Bug-Track-System

Objective
Build a distributed bug tracking system, inspired by tools like Jira, using the concept of Tuple
Spaces for communication and coordination. We will simulate the roles of:
 Product Owner (who submits bugs)
 Developers (who pick up and resolve bugs)

We’ll use tuple space coordination to simulate distributed workflows, and build minimal UIs
for each role to interact with the system.
