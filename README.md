# Distributed-Bug-Track-System

### Objective <br>
Build a distributed bug tracking system, inspired by tools like Jira, using the concept of Tuple
Spaces for communication and coordination. We will simulate the roles of: <br>
- Product Owner (who submits bugs) <br>
- Developers (who pick up and resolve bugs) <br>
<br>
Weâ€™ll use tuple space coordination to simulate distributed workflows, and build minimal UIs
for each role to interact with the system.
